Notes: 
* Mago is a manga artist.
* Hiromi: I can't comment on the ending plot of DarliFra, but I was satisfied with the DitF ending animation sequence. (which he produced)
* Many Japanese studios/production committees don't put much thought/look into the dubbing process from overseas distributors; Trigger would be interested in directing the dub if the opportunity arises. (00:35:00)

Notes:
* Hiromi: For all Imaishi/Nakashima works, they don't like settling birthday/zodiac symbol. Most characters in their series don't have publicly disclosed birthdays or zodiac symbols. According to Nakashima, he doesn't want his character to be swayed by their birth dates/zodiac symbols and wants viewers to judge how they are portrayed in the story. (00:16:30)
* Halloween isn't big/relatively new in Japan, except for nightlife in Shibuya recently the past 5 years (00:25:49)
* [10 minute timelapse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5ZEGT3H60o)
* Shunpei is using the dry ink brush (profile) which has a pencil stroke/texture to it, very popular among other staff (00:28:35)
* Sushio was ego-searching/looking up his name on Twitter for Promare(?) (00:46:30)
* When they were transitioning to digital, Yoshinari said Imaishi was better with traditional paper/pencil (00:51:30)
