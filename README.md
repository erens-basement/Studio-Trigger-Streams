Notes:
* Sakurai eventually wants to become a key animator and try being an episode director.
* He's using an Intos 5 tablet medium size, his own personal equipment.
* Put in a request to draw a girl. He likes drawing human characters and not mechanical objects.
* Q: Would Trigger hire more foreign animators if the language barrier is solved? Hiromi: There are a multitude of reasons we can't hire foreign animators, like visas, etc. We do hire several overseas staff. It's more of a financial issue for Trigger, like sustaining visas are expensive.  
* In terms of animation, Sakurai watches a little of Disney, Pixar, and looking forward to the Spiderverse film.

### 4. [Live Drawing 4 - Mago drawing Luluco from Space Patrol Luluco and Trigger-chan (mascot)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/394802437?t=0h6m8s)

Notes: 
* Mago is a manga artist.
* Hiromi: I can't comment on the ending plot of DarliFra, but I was satisfied with the DitF ending animation sequence. (which he produced)
* Many Japanese studios/production committees don't put much thought/look into the dubbing process from overseas distributors; Trigger would be interested in directing the dub if the opportunity arises. (00:35:00)    

### 5. [Live Drawing 5 - Kazuki Chiba drawing Sucy from Little Witch Academia (Part 1)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/431029877) | [Part 2](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/431043693)
Date: May 28, 2019<br>
Artist: Kazuki Chiba<br> 
Description: Sucy from Little Witch Academia<br>
Guests: Hiromi (producer), 2 new PAs (00:24:20)<br>
Tools: Wacom Cintiq 16 Tablet/Photoshop CC 2014<br>
Finished artwork: [.JPG Link](https://www.patreon.com/posts/reward-5th-live-27237214) | [.PSD Link](https://www.patreon.com/join/TRIGGER/reward-5th-live-27237493) (patron access)<br>
Notes:<br>
Part 1:
* Staff experience ranges from half a year to 30 years (the president).
* When do you hire PAs? Trigger starts looking for PAs from late summer to fall, but people come in as part time or intern prior to graduating college.
* KLK is the most valuable IP, original rights for Gridman lie between Subarai(?, creator of Gridman) and Trigger, so they do see some of the royalties when merch is sold.
* Sushio likes paper and pencil over digital.
* Chiba doesn't really have a preference in drawing, mechs or people, guy or girl, etc. But he does like drawing Muzzle from Trigger girls. 
* Anohana was the first anime Chiba watched. He didn't watch anime that much but still drew a lot.
* Chiba's favorite character is Mako from KLK, he likes her look at personality.
* He used to work in media oriented work, and never worked on anime before Trigger. 
* Hard to get a job for chara designer or illustrator? H: no clean cut answer for this question, Shigeto Koriyama is character design/illustration, but he also provides input to story and project, if you can add more than just character design, then you’ll be fine in the industry. 
* Hobby: Chiba likes listening to radio.  

Part 2:
* Sushio-san and Tanaka-san was mentor especially for Kill la Kill and Anohana. Sushio worked as an in-between animator for DitF and Chiba got to meet Tanaka-san. (00:03:00)
* He wants to first become a chief animator, he wants to become staff and fill in spots, and experience various aspects (00:06:00)
* Most memorable work? He recently became a key animator form Promare, and he was able to work with Sushio. That's why it was so memorable, and more pressure. (0:09:00)
* H: The more we use CGI in a show, the more cost effective it becomes. If it's only for 12 episodes, traditional animation is cheaper. For > 12 episodes or more seasons, CGI is cheaper. The more you use it the cheaper it becomes. 00:13:00)
* He grew up with Yuusha series and Digimon. Hiromi grew up with Ghibli, Disney, Doraemon. 
* Currently the live-streams are held in an empty room and it takes 3 hours to move the gear. Trigger is planning on moving and soon. Once they move, Moving out of Ogikubo, Integral Tower. Tattun gets his own streaming cubicle. (00:21:00)
* [Best comedy series says Tattun and Hiromi.](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B4%E3%81%AA%E3%81%97%E3%82%B2%E3%83%B3%E3%81%A8%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E7%89%A9%E8%AA%9E%EF%BC%881%EF%BC%89-%E3%83%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9E%E3%82%ACKC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%9A%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AB-%E5%B9%B3%E6%9C%AC-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A9/dp/4063367916) Oremonogatari, アゴなしゲンとオレ物語. You should learn Japanese just for this. The OG Prison School. [Link](https://www.twitch.tv/studio_trigger/clip/CreativeCooperativeStorkTF2John) (00:26:00) 
* Shiba was still an intern at Trigger when they were doing LWA (TV), but he was involved in the game(?) for LWA.
* H: Last year at the cons, a lot of overseas fans are very keen on Q&As, they know how to push buttons, all the questions he wanted to answer were asked within the first few minutes. Overseas fans have an interesting perspective and he enjoys the unique questions he's never thought about. 
* What studio or what director would you like to work with? Chiba is currently learning under Director Amemiya, so he is amemiya's padawan. he's interested in working with him next.
* Comments: Studio Trigger is a whore to working with anyone. T: We don't take any shame in that
* Favorite US restaurants? Hiromi really loves IHOP, which is why there are so many in Promare. In LA, Hiromi loves Sap (Thai food). Most likely this restaurant: [Sapp Coffee Shop](https://goo.gl/maps/eM9ut5tTbc6jiXzs9)



### 6. [Live Drawing 6 - Akira Amemiya drawing a GRIDMAN Shikishi for AX](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/445297992?t=01h03m30s)
Date: Jun 28, 2019<br>
Artist:Akira Amemiya (director/animator)<br>
Description: GRIDMAN Mecha Shikishiki for Anime Expo<br>
Guests: Hiromi<br>
Tools: Shikishi board/Mechanical pencil, Magic pen<br>
Finished artwork: N/A<br>
Notes:
* Amemiya: you gotta pray before you illustration. Visualize in your head and when you get a good image, then pick up the pen.
* Amemiya: using a random mechanical pencil he found on the floor the other day to draw. You can't put your soul in it through digital devices/electronics. Praying is most important, doesn't matter what utensil you use.
* Amemiya: I've never screwed up in my life before so I don't know failure. [Link](https://clips.twitch.tv/OriginalPlayfulBananaLitty)
* Amemiya is known to be the fast animator in Trigger and did 40 cuts for GRIDMAN.
* When he was in college, he was in the animation club with his senpai. They were all interested in producing anime and where his career started. Normal college.
* Amemiya: I never intentionally practiced human anatomy, but the book ['Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' by Edwards](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1585429201) helped with learning anatomy for animation (1:21:01)
* Alexis in Gridman was designed by Koyama, chara de for Promare.
* Hiromi really wants to do a Baywatch anime.
* Anno and Eva impacted on his life, not just Gridman.
* A: Doing more illustrations means you'll be faster. I may be fast, but Yoshinari is 5x faster. 
* Q: Is it possible to be in the industry without animation school experience? A: I'm self taught, but being in the industry it does help to come from the schools. But at the end, it all boils down to if you're good or not.
* Gainax motto: it doesn't matter how much experience you ahve in the industry, just if you're good or not. Gainax style: just get good.
* Everything went smooth and well because I prayed.
* Can you become an episode director from a PA? Mr. Mizushima did this, started from PA to director, Full Metal Alchemist.
* What separates a pro from an amateur animator? H+A: There's no license in Japan for a "pro" animator. Professionals would be ones who receive a commission or request from a client. Amateur are people who do art for fun.





### 7. [Live Drawing 7 - Shigeto Koyama drawing Galo from PROMARE](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/480768644?t=0h2m48s) 
Date: September 13, 2019<br>
Artist: Shigeto Koyama (designer)<br>
Description: Galo from PROMARE<br>
Guests: Hiromi (producer)<br>
Tools: Apple Macbook Pro 2015, Wacom Cintiq Pro 16" Tablet, Clip Studio Paint, Adobe Photoshop<br>
Finished artwork: [.JPG Link](https://www.patreon.com/posts/reward-trigger-30102938) | [.PSD Link](https://www.patreon.com/join/TRIGGER/reward-trigger-30103231) (patron access)<br>
Timelapse videos: [10 minute version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9spwbklxRvg) | [full version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5ZEGT3H60o)<br>
Notes:
* Hiromi oversaw the selection for the dubbing voice actor of Galo.
* Koyama doesn't have that much free time to draw for fun, used to, but not now. But he doodles from time to time on towels or napkins. Like trump doodles.
* Q: Any advice for aspiring animators? K: Not much he can comment, young people are really talented these days. If I could say anything, I want all talented people to jump off a building with their arms spread so they can't draw anymore. [Link](https://clips.twitch.tv/GrossAwkwardDumplingsTwitchRPG) (00:40:00)
* K: Lio is my favorite character but he also likes drawing Ignis.
* Koyoma has a PS brush preset called pubic hair brush.
* Hiromi specifically requested the tiny tail on the back of Lio de Galo.
* Q: How many episode runners (PAs) do you hire per year? A: About 3 PAs per year, usually when they get experience, they'll go up to episode director or producer. That's why they're always in a deficit per year.
* For the CG, they used Software is 3ds max , sangigen did 3D for promare 
* For Nakashima’s works, he doesn’t want to have birthdays so people aren’t concerned about the tiny details. 
* How do you determine which scene gets revised for blu ray release? (retake) It’s usually if a certain scene isn’t executed as intended, color was off, very technical details. Requests come from both studio and sponsor.
* What would you do if you were a civilian or promopilis? K: They wouldn’t be eating the pizzas for sure, but they’ll probably try to overthrow the governor or become a bro with the governor.
* We made a lot of requests for the dub with Galo. We want zac efron plus Channing Tatum for galo. (1:37:00) 
* If there is a promare manga, it has to be full color. 
* It takes three times more effort to draw promare than other anime. Normally they use one outline color black/brown for outlines, for promare, they used self colored lines, outline color for hair, clothing, and third one for skin tones. It takes 3 times more effort to execute. It was not the colorists on their own, request from director. 
* The G on the Matoi tech stands for Gaian gear, manufacturer in the Promare universe.
* Hiromi chose pizza because it’s something you share with family or friends/communal type of food, symbolize burning rescue as a team.
* They tweaked and messed around with the kanji for the tattoos in promare and made a common mistake they see people in America with kanji/Chinese tattoos. 
* Yonkers fire station in New York, idea came from the captain who had his own jacket but customized to be like a staff which is where they got the ideal for differing uniforms. 2:20
* To respect Nakashima, they can't be too liberal with their Geek Boat universe stories they have to check in once in a while. H: according to the last stream, Nakashima said.
* H: they were pretty finished before they received the main theme track/song, so they made requests to stretch out parts of the music etc to fit the scene better.
* Q: How did you get started as character designer and starter artbooks? For artbook, Koyama suggests Sushi encyclopedia. Reasoning is if you don't eat good food, you won't get better at drawing. You have to start from knowing which food is delicious 2:35:00
https://clips.twitch.tv/ConsiderateInventiveWallabyWholeWheat
* Drawing illustration was always something Koyama did but he became aware when he worked for Diebuster the joy of designing instead of illustrating. 
* The PC, mics, streaming equipment was all supported by Patreon funding.



### 8. [Live Drawing 8 - Shunpei Gunyasu drawing Lio from PROMARE, Halloween-themed](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/499247339?t=0h2m18s) 
Date: Oct 25, 2019<br>
Artist: Shunpei Gunyasu (key animator)<br>
Description: Lio from PROMARE, Halloween-themed<br>
Guests: Hiromi (producer)<br>
Tools: iPad Pro 3rd Gen. and Apple Pencil Gen 2/Procreate<br>
Finished artwork: [.JPG Link](https://www.patreon.com/posts/reward-trigger-31155436) | [.PSD Link](https://www.patreon.com/join/TRIGGER/reward-trigger-31155287) (patron access)<br>
Timelapse video: [10 minute version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5ZEGT3H60o) | [full version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QL87ep2Jas)<br>
Notes:
* Hiromi: For all Imaishi/Nakashima works, they don't like settling birthday/zodiac symbol. Most characters in their series don't have publicly disclosed birthdays or zodiac symbols. According to Nakashima, he doesn't want his character to be swayed by their birth dates/zodiac symbols and wants viewers to judge how they are portrayed in the story. (00:16:30)
* Halloween isn't big/relatively new in Japan, except for nightlife in Shibuya recently the past 5 years (00:25:49)
* Shunpei is using the dry ink brush (profile) which has a pencil stroke/texture to it, very popular among other staff (00:28:35)
* Sushio was ego-searching/looking up his name on Twitter for Promare(?) (00:46:30)
* When they were transitioning to digital, Yoshinari said Imaishi was better with traditional paper/pencil (00:51:30)


### 9. [Christmas Live Drawing Special - Imaishi animating a sequence with PROMARE characters](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/526051066?t=0h6m57s)
Date: December 25, 2019<br>
Artist: Hiroyuki Imaishi (director/animator)<br>
Description: Animation sequence with Galo, Lio from PROMARE<br>
Guests: Shigeto Koyama, Hiromi Wakabayashi, Mami, Otsuka (president) (00:58:00), Amemiya (1:12:50)<br>
Tools: Wacom Cintiq 22" Tablet (non-pro), Windows 10, TVPaint Animation (program)<br>
Finished artwork: [Patreon Link](https://www.patreon.com/posts/reward-from-2019-33410098)<br>
Notes:
* I: I learned anime on paper and pencil so I believe I am much faster/proficient on old fashioned method still. However, that is a very selfish answer. If i were to think about the entire process animating like compositing and coloring, digital medium makes the whole process seamless and less stressful (00:44:00)
* Q: What made you good in drawing, talent or hard work? I: You can get to a certain level with hardwork. However, in order to really shine in the industry, you need the talent. Also it's complicated because the folks that are talented don't last in the industry long. That's a good question, but a very difficult question. I believe I remained in the industry due to hard work. The saying to keep practicing holds true. I'd like to think myself as a man who maintained and got up through hard work. (00:45:00)
* The only educational assets I ever referenced were the animation works from Kogawa Tomonori. I self taught myself through other animators. (00:49:00)
* I: I used to like the drumsticks when I was younger but I found somewhere down the line that the breasts and wings taste better. Now I like the breasts. (00:50:00)
* Imaishi has an easier time drawing robots and mechs than human characters.
* Koyama: Basic advice is to not use a white canvas for color. White canvas is the brightest setting you can use. Darker color like gray it's easier to pinpoint or notice where you spot a mistake. (01:18:00)
* It would be convenient to have a 3D animator because Trigger is a very 2D oriented studio, so it would definitely be a luxury. We can't rpovdie the 3d animator with enough work to warrant the expenditure of hiring. Having a colorist, etc in house is ideal, but the cost can't be justified. (1:21:00)
* I: In the original storyboard for PROMARE, when Lio and his boys are escaping the prison. Theere is a scene where Lio confronts Vulcan and there was an aerial combat scene. I even had that scene cleaned up by Yoshinari but unfortunately we never used it. If we had it, there would be too many fight scenes. It was a balance issue, we omitted it for. (1:30:00)
* We really don't know why PS&G is popular overseas because we never really did any promotion there. We do believe that visiting various anime conventions, PSG would be more overseas than Japan, but we do know there are a few hardcore fans in Japan (01:39:00) 
* If we ever get to do s2 psg, we want to do the ghost explosion scenes overseas. we want to go to a place with liberal firearms laws like texas or russia. Find some old guy with actual explosives, like rpg's. Ask him to shoot our props and blow them up and place that in instead of explosion scenes. (1:42:00)
* Q: Animators you're interested in, in house and overseas? I: In house, I'm very interested how Ikarashi and Kaneko will turn out. We have some newcomers like Nakamura, Dohee, and Kano who are good at single character illustrations. (1:52:00)
* Q: Waka said you review everyone you hire. What do you look for in a new employee. Would you promote a PA or someone who's not an animator to ach-tsu(?) A: So we definitely do, we have few PAs that become achstu or episodic directors. So it's definitely possible. We defintiely do have to check an animator's skill and prepare a curriculum to teach or train that individual. (1:59:00) 
* Imaishi wants to go to Russia. Find an event willing to fly them out because Trigger is interested. We want to try out some borsch(?). (2:00:00)
* Artists don't share brush presets because once at a high level, it's hard to distinguish good art from each other. Artists then tweak brush presets to be unique, (02:08:00)
* During the Gainax age, Imaishi owes most to Tsurumaki or Ono-san as inspiration. (02:10:00)
* Q: There should be a Trigger convention. A: We would have the staff hold up platform with Imaishi in his underwear like Xerxes from the 300 and throwing Trigger dollar bills (02:16:30)  
* Q: Is Galo drawn with smaller hands with gloves off? A: They got to try on firefighting equipment (in NYC for location scouting, Promare), like gloves that are big and thick. Galo's hand is portrayed a lot smaller without his gloves on. (2:18:00)
* Imaishi tries to pose himself/reinact scene to draw a more dynamic pose. Tattun took Imaishi to a shooting range recently and it was his first time shooting several pistols. Imaishi says it didn't change much but it gave him a whole new perspective on the weight, recoil. (2:24:30)
* 4DX: Imaishi: To emphasize on the Lio reveal (his feminime look in contrast with his suit) in the scene where his mask cracks, they added a smell there.
* They didn't expect PROMARE to have such a good reception and long screening time in Japan. 
* Hiromi: Since a movie takes so long to produce, it's unresting you don't know how it will be perceived until it's released. Generally movies are screened for 4 weeks. If it doesn't do well in the first release, it's detrimental. A short TV series will be broadcasted for 3 months so there's good and bad for both projects. Hell is usually around delivery date. For TV series, the hell repeats every episode while a movie is one really rough hell. Pick your poison. (02:41:00)
* Q: I love Imaishi's design, but he rarely uses his own designs and has character designers. Will he use his own character designs for an anime again? I: My designs are really strong for very manga, comic-like energy for the characters, but for dramatic scenes, they don't translate very well. When my design has to work with an actual script, it doesn't do the script justice. If there's a project where my designs suit the content, atmosphere of the series, he wouldn't mind doing the character designs. (3:53:00)



## Tattun Streams
Streams where he's flipping through in-betweens and answering questions

### [In betweens Mar 21, 2020](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/576478865)
Date: Mar 21 2020
Note:
* If trigger goes in quarantine and self isolation, BNA will not finish. [Link](https://www.twitch.tv/studio_trigger/clip/ImportantDeterminedMageTinyFace)
* Tattun hates the concept of time and deadlines.
* T: You think AX is sweaty and smelly? AX is a breeze compared to comiket.
* I was going to say K-on was for old creepy dudes, but people would've been mad. K-on is for...everyone
* Before people would visit the Trigger office and they would let them have a peak of the studio. It was cool when people said they were from Mexico. Biggest reason for stopping people from visiting the studio was the Kickstarter studio tour tier prize. (1:10:00)
* Tattun lives with his grandmother.
* Tattun's cat will piss on him out of spite in the morning if he doesn't wake up. 


### [In betweens March 31, 2020](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/579679446)
Dates: March 31, 2020
Notes: 
* Q: Do the staff ever ask you to translate for leisure? All the time, for movies they would take him to Star Wars and Solo to as him.
* He fell asleep for Solo and Black Panther, he had to watch Black Panther 3 times and Solo twice (they were visiting in the states)
* Whiplash was the lat moving he really enjoyed. And Rush (car movie).
* He also likes Narcos.
* Tattun was a bad kid and mom gave up teaching him japanese, he didn't know how to write his name and wasted time at Japanese school. He eventually learned Japanese from adult games.
* Only time they've done April Fool's was when they've announced Trigger girls on April 1st but they actually revealed them. 
* 1st episode took several months to make while last episode was relatively quick (a few weeks) for KILL la KILL. 
* Mago draws Tattun with large pupils and as a bird.
* I have never taken drugs in my life. I'm super lightweight.



### [Inbetweens April 1, 2020](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/580438363)
Date: April 1, 2020
Notes: 
* Q: Do the staff ever ask you to translate for leisure? All the time, for movies they would take him to Star Wars and Solo to as him.
* For an internship with Trigger, you need to get a Japanese Visa yourself, be able to speak, write in Japanese, baseline requirements. (01:51:00)
* T: Hot take: Gaming journalists are all fake news, it's exactly the same with anitubers. Nevermind, I take it back. I would like to apologize. If you're really curious about a question, ask the folks who make it, not "experts" on the subject. (02:12:42)
* Q: Favorite BNA character? T: I really like Jackie, she's like the ugly raccoon bear. I don't like Nazuna or Michiru. Nazuna and Michiru's personality is icky, I don't like it. (02:23:15)
* T: When I praise this figure [his bunnysuit Ryuuko figure], I really mean it. This figure is super good quality, like 200 bucks, but it's worth the 200 bucks. (02:29:00)
* T: Most I've gotten in trouble for was disclosing the cost for an anime episode in the past. The exec folks were super mad. (02:38:34)
* T: I'm the studio's PR. They call me Tatsun, I don't know why they call me that. My real name is Tatsuru. It started when a certain celebrity said Tattun's name was boring and she would call him Tatsun from that point. Then it stuck. (02:48:00)
* T: I am treated as the clown and joke of the studio. Oh that dude's doing some random crap that isn't gonna go well, wasting everyone's time. (02:52:00)
