Notes: 
* Mago is a manga artist.
* Hiromi: I can't comment on the ending plot of DarliFra, but I was satisfied with the DitF ending animation sequence. (which he produced)
* Many Japanese studios/production committees don't put much thought/look into the dubbing process from overseas distributors; Trigger would be interested in directing the dub if the opportunity arises. (00:35:00)

Notes:
* Hiromi: For all Imaishi/Nakashima works, they don't like settling birthday/zodiac symbol. Most characters in their series don't have publicly disclosed birthdays or zodiac symbols. According to Nakashima, he doesn't want his character to be swayed by their birth dates/zodiac symbols and wants viewers to judge how they are portrayed in the story. (00:16:30)
* Halloween isn't big/relatively new in Japan, except for nightlife in Shibuya recently the past 5 years (00:25:49)
* Shunpei is using the dry ink brush (profile) which has a pencil stroke/texture to it, very popular among other staff (00:28:35)
* Sushio was ego-searching/looking up his name on Twitter for Promare(?) (00:46:30)
* When they were transitioning to digital, Yoshinari said Imaishi was better with traditional paper/pencil (00:51:30)

Notes:
* I: I learned anime on paper and pencil so I believe I am much faster/proficient on old fashioned method still. However, that is a very selfish answer. If i were to think about the entire process animating like compositing and coloring, digital medium makes the whole process seamless and less stressful (00:44:00)
* Q: What made you good in drawing, talent or hard work? I: You can get to a certain level with hardwork. However, in order to really shine in the industry, you need the talent. Also it's complicated because the folks that are talented don't last in the industry long. That's a good question, but a very difficult question. I believe I remained in the industry due to hard work. The saying to keep practicing holds true. I'd like to think myself as a man who maintained and got up through hard work. (00:45:00)
* The only educational assets I ever referenced were the animation works from Kogawa Tomonori. I self taught myself through other animators. (00:49:00)
* I: I used to like the drumsticks when I was younger but I found somewhere down the line that the breasts and wings taste better. Now I like the breasts. (00:50:00)
* Imaishi has an easier time drawing robots and mechs than human characters.


## Tattun Streams
Streams where he's flipping through in-betweens and answering questions

### [Inbetweens April 1, 2020](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/580438363)
Date: April 1, 2020
Notes: 
* Q: Do the staff ever ask you to translate for leisure? All the time, for movies they would take him to Star Wars and Solo to as him.
* For an internship with Trigger, you need to get a Japanese Visa yourself, be able to speak, write in Japanese, baseline requirements. (01:51:00)
* T: Hot take: Gaming journalists are all fake news, it's exactly the same with anitubers. Nevermind, I take it back. I would like to apologize. If you're really curious about a question, ask the folks who make it, not "experts" on the subject. (02:12:42)
* Q: Favorite BNA character? T: I really like Jackie, she's like the ugly raccoon bear. I don't like Nazuna or Michiru. Nazuna and Michiru's personality is icky, I don't like it. (02:23:15)
* T: When I praise this figure [his bunnysuit Ryuuko figure], I really mean it. This figure is super good quality, like 200 bucks, but it's worth the 200 bucks. (02:29:00)
* T: Most I've gotten in trouble for was disclosing the cost for an anime episode in the past. The exec folks were super mad. (02:38:34)
* T: I'm the studio's PR. They call me Tatsun, I don't know why they call me that. My real name is Tatsuru. It started when a certain celebrity said Tattun's name was boring and she would call him Tatsun from that point. Then it stuck. (02:48:00)
* T: I am treated as the clown and joke of the studio. Oh that dude's doing some random crap that isn't gonna go well, wasting everyone's time. (02:52:00)
