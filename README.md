### 3. [Live Drawing 3 - Tetsuya Sakurai drawing Satsuki from KILL la KILL](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/383698751?t=00h27m02s)

Notes:
* Sakurai eventually wants to become a key animator and try being an episode director.
* He's using an Intos 5 tablet medium size, his own personal equipment.
* Put in a request to draw a girl. He likes drawing human characters and not mechanical objects.
* Q: Would Trigger hire more foreign animators if the language barrier is solved? Hiromi: There are a multitude of reasons we can't hire foreign animators, like visas, etc. We do hire several overseas staff. It's more of a financial issue for Trigger, like sustaining visas are expensive.  
* In terms of animation, Sakurai watches a little of Disney, Pixar, and looking forward to the Spiderverse film.

### 4. [Live Drawing 4 - Mago drawing Luluco from Space Patrol Luluco and Trigger-chan (mascot)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/394802437?t=0h6m8s)

Notes: 
* Mago is a manga artist.
* Hiromi: I can't comment on the ending plot of DarliFra, but I was satisfied with the DitF ending animation sequence. (which he produced)
* Many Japanese studios/production committees don't put much thought/look into the dubbing process from overseas distributors; Trigger would be interested in directing the dub if the opportunity arises. (00:35:00)    

### 5. [Live Drawing 5 - Kazuki Chiba drawing Sucy from Little Witch Academia (Part 1)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/431029877) | [Part 2](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/431043693)

Notes:

Part 2:
* Sushio-san and Tanaka-san was mentor especially for Kill la Kill and Anohana. Sushio worked as an in-between animator for DitF and he got to meet Tanaka-san. (00:03:00)
* He wants to first become a chief animator, he wants to become staff and fill in spots, and experience various aspects (00:06:00)
* Most memorable work? He recently became a key animator form Promare, and he was able to work with Sushio. That's why it was so memorable, and more pressure. (0:09:00)
* H: The more we use CGI in a show, the more cost effective it becomes. If it's only for 12 episodes, traditional animation is cheaper. For > 12 episodes or more seasons, CGI is cheaper. The more you use it the cheaper it becomes. 00:13:00)
* He grew up with Yuusha series and Digimon. Hiromi grew up with Ghibli, Disney, Doraemon.

Timelapse video: [10 minute version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5ZEGT3H60o) | [full version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QL87ep2Jas)<br>
Notes:
* Hiromi: For all Imaishi/Nakashima works, they don't like settling birthday/zodiac symbol. Most characters in their series don't have publicly disclosed birthdays or zodiac symbols. According to Nakashima, he doesn't want his character to be swayed by their birth dates/zodiac symbols and wants viewers to judge how they are portrayed in the story. (00:16:30)
* Halloween isn't big/relatively new in Japan, except for nightlife in Shibuya recently the past 5 years (00:25:49)
* Shunpei is using the dry ink brush (profile) which has a pencil stroke/texture to it, very popular among other staff (00:28:35)
* Sushio was ego-searching/looking up his name on Twitter for Promare(?) (00:46:30)
* When they were transitioning to digital, Yoshinari said Imaishi was better with traditional paper/pencil (00:51:30)


### 9. [Christmas Live Drawing Special - Imaishi animating a sequence with PROMARE characters](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/526051066?t=0h6m57s)
Date: December 25, 2019<br>
Artist: Hiroyuki Imaishi (director/animator)<br>
Description: Animation sequence with Galo, Lio from PROMARE<br>
Guests: Shigeto Koyama, Hiromi Wakabayashi, Mami, Otsuka (president) (00:58:00), Amemiya (1:12:50)<br>
Tools: Wacom Cintiq 22" Tablet (non-pro), Windows 10, TVPaint Animation (program)<br>
Finished artwork: [Patreon Link](https://www.patreon.com/posts/reward-from-2019-33410098)<br>
Notes:
* I: I learned anime on paper and pencil so I believe I am much faster/proficient on old fashioned method still. However, that is a very selfish answer. If i were to think about the entire process animating like compositing and coloring, digital medium makes the whole process seamless and less stressful (00:44:00)
* Q: What made you good in drawing, talent or hard work? I: You can get to a certain level with hardwork. However, in order to really shine in the industry, you need the talent. Also it's complicated because the folks that are talented don't last in the industry long. That's a good question, but a very difficult question. I believe I remained in the industry due to hard work. The saying to keep practicing holds true. I'd like to think myself as a man who maintained and got up through hard work. (00:45:00)
* The only educational assets I ever referenced were the animation works from Kogawa Tomonori. I self taught myself through other animators. (00:49:00)
* I: I used to like the drumsticks when I was younger but I found somewhere down the line that the breasts and wings taste better. Now I like the breasts. (00:50:00)
* Imaishi has an easier time drawing robots and mechs than human characters.
* Koyama: Basic advice is to not use a white canvas for color. White canvas is the brightest setting you can use. Darker color like gray it's easier to pinpoint or notice where you spot a mistake. (01:18:00)
* It would be convenient to have a 3D animator because Trigger is a very 2D oriented studio, so it would definitely be a luxury. We can't rpovdie the 3d animator with enough work to warrant the expenditure of hiring. Having a colorist, etc in house is ideal, but the cost can't be justified. (1:21:00)
* I: In the original storyboard for PROMARE, when Lio and his boys are escaping the prison. Theere is a scene where Lio confronts Vulcan and there was an aerial combat scene. I even had that scene cleaned up by Yoshinari but unfortunately we never used it. If we had it, there would be too many fight scenes. It was a balance issue, we omitted it for. (1:30:00)
* We really don't know why PS&G is popular overseas because we never really did any promotion there. We do believe that visiting various anime conventions, PSG would be more overseas than Japan, but we do know there are a few hardcore fans in Japan (01:39:00) 
* If we ever get to do s2 psg, we want to do the ghost explosion scenes overseas. we want to go to a place with liberal firearms laws like texas or russia. Find some old guy with actual explosives, like rpg's. Ask him to shoot our props and blow them up and place that in instead of explosion scenes. (1:42:00)
* Q: Animators you're interested in, in house and overseas? I: In house, I'm very interested how Ikarashi and Kaneko will turn out. We have some newcomers like Nakamura, Dohee, and Kano who are good at single character illustrations. (1:52:00)
* Q: Waka said you review everyone you hire. What do you look for in a new employee. Would you promote a PA or someone who's not an animator to ach-tsu(?) A: So we definitely do, we have few PAs that become achstu or episodic directors. So it's definitely possible. We defintiely do have to check an animator's skill and prepare a curriculum to teach or train that individual. (1:59:00) 
* Imaishi wants to go to Russia. Find an event willing to fly them out because Trigger is interested. We want to try out some borsch(?). (2:00:00)
* Artists don't share brush presets because once at a high level, it's hard to distinguish good art from each other. Artists then tweak brush presets to be unique, (02:08:00)
* During the Gainax age, Imaishi owes most to Tsurumaki or Ono-san as inspiration. (02:10:00)
* Q: There should be a Trigger convention. A: We would have the staff hold up platform with Imaishi in his underwear like Xerxes from the 300 and throwing Trigger dollar bills (02:16:30)  
* Q: Is Galo drawn with smaller hands with gloves off? A: They got to try on firefighting equipment (in NYC for location scouting, Promare), like gloves that are big and thick. Galo's hand is portrayed a lot smaller without his gloves on. (2:18:00)
* Imaishi tries to pose himself/reinact scene to draw a more dynamic pose. Tattun took Imaishi to a shooting range recently and it was his first time shooting several pistols. Imaishi says it didn't change much but it gave him a whole new perspective on the weight, recoil. (2:24:30)
* 4DX: Imaishi: To emphasize on the Lio reveal (his feminime look in contrast with his suit) in the scene where his mask cracks, they added a smell there.
* They didn't expect PROMARE to have such a good reception and long screening time in Japan. 
* Hiromi: Since a movie takes so long to produce, it's unresting you don't know how it will be perceived until it's released. Generally movies are screened for 4 weeks. If it doesn't do well in the first release, it's detrimental. A short TV series will be broadcasted for 3 months so there's good and bad for both projects. Hell is usually around delivery date. For TV series, the hell repeats every episode while a movie is one really rough hell. Pick your poison. (02:41:00)
* Q: I love Imaishi's design, but he rarely uses his own designs and has character designers. Will he use his own character designs for an anime again? I: My designs are really strong for very manga, comic-like energy for the characters, but for dramatic scenes, they don't translate very well. When my design has to work with an actual script, it doesn't do the script justice. If there's a project where my designs suit the content, atmosphere of the series, he wouldn't mind doing the character designs. (3:53:00)



## Tattun Streams
Streams where he's flipping through in-betweens and answering questions

### [In betweens March 31, 2020](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/579679446)
Dates: March 31, 2020
Notes: 
* Q: Do the staff ever ask you to translate for leisure? All the time, for movies they would take him to Star Wars and Solo to as him.
* He fell asleep for Solo and Black Panther, he had to watch Black Panther 3 times and Solo twice (they were visiting in the states)
* Whiplash was the lat moving he really enjoyed. And Rush (car movie).


### [Inbetweens April 1, 2020](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/580438363)
Date: April 1, 2020
Notes: 
* Q: Do the staff ever ask you to translate for leisure? All the time, for movies they would take him to Star Wars and Solo to as him.
* For an internship with Trigger, you need to get a Japanese Visa yourself, be able to speak, write in Japanese, baseline requirements. (01:51:00)
* T: Hot take: Gaming journalists are all fake news, it's exactly the same with anitubers. Nevermind, I take it back. I would like to apologize. If you're really curious about a question, ask the folks who make it, not "experts" on the subject. (02:12:42)
* Q: Favorite BNA character? T: I really like Jackie, she's like the ugly raccoon bear. I don't like Nazuna or Michiru. Nazuna and Michiru's personality is icky, I don't like it. (02:23:15)
* T: When I praise this figure [his bunnysuit Ryuuko figure], I really mean it. This figure is super good quality, like 200 bucks, but it's worth the 200 bucks. (02:29:00)
* T: Most I've gotten in trouble for was disclosing the cost for an anime episode in the past. The exec folks were super mad. (02:38:34)
* T: I'm the studio's PR. They call me Tatsun, I don't know why they call me that. My real name is Tatsuru. It started when a certain celebrity said Tattun's name was boring and she would call him Tatsun from that point. Then it stuck. (02:48:00)
* T: I am treated as the clown and joke of the studio. Oh that dude's doing some random crap that isn't gonna go well, wasting everyone's time. (02:52:00)
